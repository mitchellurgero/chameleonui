# ChameleonUI
Windows 7+ UI for GNUSocial instances running Qvitter.

This project right now is in super alpha stages, some bits might now work, or even be implemented (See feature list for up-to-date stuff.)
It needs a WHOLE lot of work, like proper password storage. (So don't use it on a shared computer!!)

## Features
Not much as of yet. All basic stuff has been implemented, emphesis on *basic*

- Login and Logout working on any server with a proper SSL Cert and Qvitter.
- Posting a new status, or replying to one works.
- Liking, Staring, etc working
- Reposting (Retweeting) working as well
